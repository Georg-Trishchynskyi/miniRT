# miniRT

Project for 42 Wolfsburg.

As it's said in the name it's a mini/basic ray-tracing using the CPU based on Blinnâ€“Phong reflection model.
This project can handle several shapes such as spheres, planes, cylinders, triangles, and hyperboloids.
Support features like reflection, refraction, colored light, multithreading, textures, and bump textures.

## Installation

   clone repo then change a directory and compile
 + `https://github.com/kraf24/miniRT.git`
 + `cd miniRT
 + `make`

## Usage
   When you run the program it must have two arguments, the first one is the program and the second one is a map file that should end with ".rt"
  
  `./miniRT scenes/<some_scene>.rt`

## Map Creation
  If you want to create your own map or change the existing one here is information about existing presets
   
   | Abbriviation | Name | Properties |
| :------------ |:---------------:| :----- |
| c | camera | Center, direction, fov |
| A | ambient light |  intensity, collor |
| l | light  |  position, intensity color |
| sp | sphere |  position, diameter, color, material |
| pl | plane |  position, surface normal, color, material |
| cy | cylinder |  position, tube axis direction, diameter, length, color, material |
| tr | trinagle |  point1, point2, point3, color, material |
| hy | hyperboloid |  origin point, axis orientation, semi-major axis parameteres, radius, color, material |

Materials are stored as numbers, here are explanation of what those numbers mean:

| Number | Type |
|:------| :--------|
| 1 | Regular surface |
| 2 | Reflective surface |
| 3 | Refractive (only with spheres) |
| 4 | Earth texture no bump (only with spheres) |
| 5 | Mirror |
| 6 | Space texture (only with spheres) |
| 7 | Checkered surface |
| 8 | Sun texture (only with spheres) |
| 9 | Moon texture no bump (only with spheres) |
| 10 | Mars texture no bump (only with spheres) |
| 11 | Mercury texture no bump (only with spheres) |
| 12 | Venus texture no bump (only with spheres) |
| 13 | Jupiter texture no bump (only with spheres) |
